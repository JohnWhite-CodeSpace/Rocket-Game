# Rocket-Game
This is our project for Object Oriented Programming laboratories in Warsaw University fo Technology

BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
-Check if every graphic, text or audio files are definitely inside 'res' folder and also that they're accesable via commands inside the code. If any of those files aren't in the 'res' folder somehow or they're not accesable in any way (especially im talking about audio files) then you can try to comment those lines of code with instantiated objects that use those resources. Most of those instantiations are inside 'GamePanel' class. 
-Check also if your IDE is capable of running this program.
RULES:
-Please consoult me before commiting any changes.
-Do NOT change the extensions of audio files inside 'res' folder. Java swing, as I am aware, supports only '.wav' files. 
-Also please inform me about any bugs, performance drops and any other issues you might find while running this beta version.
BASIC INFO:
This game, as it is stated above, is a project for our Object Oriented Programming classes at the Warsaw University of Technology. This whole thing is only for educational purpouses (for now). Meybe in the future this game will be aveilable for other users, but for now its only the testing ground of our knowledge in java programming.
